Client Query Management System
The Client Query Management System is a simple yet effective platform for handling client queries. Clients can submit issues with details or images, while support agents track, manage, and close them. Built with Python, SQLite, and Streamlit, it ensures secure logins, transparent workflows, and faster resolutions with scope for future enhancements.
